# Quake 4 Mod - Kenneth Gronemann

There is a new map I found online, run the command "map zombietown1.map" from the main menu. It's a good wave shooter map for testing.

Deliverables:

1: Player Levelling

kills are tracked but reset on mapload, this actually is fair and balances the game so the player doesn't snowball

scale the amount of gas in the tank by a factor of 2 gas / kill

scale maxhealth and maxarmor by a factor of 10/kill

2: Movement abilities:

Sprint - Working (LSHIFT)

Melee - Implemented gauntlet weapon to singleplayer, working (MOUSE 4 or Keyboard 9)

Jetpack - Working complete with GUI gas meter (SPACE)

Rocketjump - working, works with rocketlauncher, napalmgun

Dodgeroll - Not implimented

3: Bullet time

Works great, 10 second timer, blue color overlay (LALT)

Feels exactly like FEAR but no recovery time, can spam; leaving it that way because it's fun

4: Varying monster attacks

Not implimented

5: Weapon Levelling

kills are tracked but reset on mapload, this actually is fair and balances the game so the player doesn't snowball

the blaster does more damage per kill

the machinegun fires more projectiles per kill but increases spread

the shotgun fires more projectiles per kill but increases spread

the rocketlauncher fires more projectiles and increases damage
